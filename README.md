===================================
Client Side & Server Side mod `1.21.1` `NeoForge` `21.1.117` (not tested on others).
It will return to the game a normal PVP of 1.7-1.8 versions, including leaving a fishing rod.

Removes the delay between strokes, when the rod hits, the essence reclines, and the auto-sprint automatically turns on without delay (unlike the vanilla sprint).

The mod is installed in the `mods` folder of your game directory.
